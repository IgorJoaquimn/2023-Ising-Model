# 2023-Ising-Model
The Ising model is a physical model that describes a system of particles with two possible states, such as spins in a magnetic material. The Metropolis algorithm is a Monte Carlo simulation method that can be used to study the behavior of this model.

In this work, several tests were carried out on the behavior of the Ising model using the Metropolis algorithm, with the aim of investigating the magnetic and thermodynamic properties of this system. Different initial spin configurations were explored, varying the temperature and the size of the lattice.

The results revealed important information about the phase transition of the Ising model, elucidating how the spins organize themselves into ordered or disordered magnetic structures, depending on the thermodynamic conditions. In addition, the analysis of thermodynamic quantities, such as magnetization and specific heat, provided a deeper understanding of the critical phenomena and properties of the system, contributing to the expansion of knowledge in statistical physics and complex systems.
